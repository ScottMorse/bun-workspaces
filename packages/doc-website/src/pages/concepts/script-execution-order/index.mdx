Using the [workspace configuration](/config), you can set an `"order"` value to sort the execution order of a script per workspace. 

#### Default Order

By default, workspaces are sorted in alphabetical order of their relative path from the project root. 

#### Configured vs. Default Order

Workspace scripts with
an `"order"` value will be executed before workspaces with no `"order"` set for the same script, falling back to the default order.

#### Example

In this example, any other workspaces in the project with an `"order"` for the `"start"` script less than `10` will be executed before this workspace, 
and any workspaces with an `"order"` for the `"start"` script greater than `10` will be executed after this workspace.
