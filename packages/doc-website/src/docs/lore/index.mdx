# Who is Bwunster?

Bwunster is the spirit of `bun-workspaces` manifest. 
Bwunster sees your workspaces with its unifying eye, 
making them one with itself, while still allowing them their 
independence and without requiring them to change for its own sake.
Some say this must be a sign of Bwunster's unconditional love for all workspaces.

Bwunster's burgers are actually made from black and pinto bean patties, seasoned with a southwestern spice blend that includes ancho chiles, smoked paprika, and a dash of cumin.

You can't see it from this angle, but underneath each bun is a generous dollop of spicy and sweet chipotle lime mayo, which acts as glue for a layer of fried shallots.

<span>By the way, one of the greatest cooking hacks of the modern era is:</span>
1. Slice shallots thin
2. Place in a microwave-safe bowl and cover with oil
3. Microwave on high for 5 minutes, stopping to stir about every minute or two
4. Strain and dry on paper towels, optionally seasoning while hot
