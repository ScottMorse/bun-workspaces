## Terms

#### Project

This is typically the same as the root of your git repository for your monorepo. This is where your top-level `package.json` 
file is located, which contains the `"workspaces"` field. 

[See Bun's documentation for more information on setting up workspaces via package.json](https://bun.sh/docs/install/workspaces).

#### Workspace

A nested package within a project. The root of a workspace is always a nested directory within the project 
that contains its own `package.json` file. 

A workspace's directory must be matched by the globs in the project root `package.json`'s `"workspaces"` field.

#### Script

In the context of `bun-workspaces`, a "script" generally refers to an entry in the `"scripts"` field in a workspace's `package.json` file by default. 

However, bun-workspaces also supports running ["inline scripts"](/concepts/inline-scripts), one-off shell commands executed from a respective workspace's directory.

## Terms in Action

This is a minimal example of a project structure. 

Placing workspaces in the `packages/` directory is a common convention but not required.
