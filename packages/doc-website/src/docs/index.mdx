  A monorepo management tool on top <br/>of native [Bun
  workspaces](https://bun.sh/docs/install/workspaces)</span></h1>
<p className="home-version">v{packageJson.version}</p>

<div className="home-list-container">
  <ul className="home-list">
    <li>Works right away, with no boilerplate required 🍔🍴</li>
    <li>Get metadata about your monorepo 🤖</li>
    <li>Run `package.json` scripts across workspaces 📋</li>
    <li>Supports running inline scripts as well ⌨️</li>
  </ul>
</div>


This tool lets you decide the complexity of how you use it. 
To get started, all you need is a normal project using [Bun's native workspaces](https://bun.sh/docs/install/workspaces) feature for nested JavaScript/TypeScript packages.

Think of this as a power suit you can snap onto native workspaces, rather than another monorepo framework.

Start running some [CLI commands](/cli) right away in your repo, or take full advantage of the [scripting API](/api) and its features.

<h2 className="whats-new-title">What's New</h2>

<h2 className="whats-new-subtitle">Notable recent updates 📦</h2>
<div className="whats-new-list">
- Added a way to set the [execution order of scripts](/concepts/script-execution-order) per workspace via the [workspace configuration](/config).
- New [script runtime metadata](/concepts/script-runtime-metadata ) can be read from environment vars or used in inline scripts and args
- Added `--inline` option to run a one-off commands (See [API](/api/reference#inline-scripts) and [CLI](/cli/commands#run-script) docs)
</div>

## Quick Start

See the [CLI Quick Start](/cli) and [API Quick Start](/api) for starting examples.


## Installation

You can install the package in your project or simply use `bunx bun-workspaces` to immediately use the latest version of the [CLI](/cli). Installation is required to use the [API](/api).

<SyntaxHighlighter language="bash">
{`# Install to use the API and/or lock your CLI version for your project
bun add --dev bun-workspaces

# Start using the CLI with or without the installation step
bunx bun-workspaces --help`}

</SyntaxHighlighter>

If you use the CLI frequently, you might consider using a shell alias.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="bash">
  {`# Add this to .bashrc, .zshrc, or similar 
# to make it available by default in your shell
alias bw="bunx bun-workspaces"`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Examples in these docs will use the alias `bw` for `bunx bun-workspaces` for brevity.
